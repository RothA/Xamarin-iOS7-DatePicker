Xamarin iOS7 Date Picker

Overview

This is date picker control that conforms to the new iOS7 design guidelines.  "iOS 7 apps tend to embed date pickers within the content instead of displaying them in a different view. For example, Calendar dynamically expands a table row to let users specify a time without leaving the event-creation view." (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/transitionguide/Controls.html)
